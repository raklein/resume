# RMarkdown CV
Builds a [.pdf CV (click to view directly)](https://github.com/raklein/resume/blob/master/klein_cv.pdf) using R Markdown and LaTex. Easily editable text fields if
you know a little R Markdown (basically plain text with a couple formatting features). If you're adventurous, 
edit cv-latex.tex (LaTeX file) to edit format/structure.

Note: My resume is out of date here and I'd direct you to my [webpage](https://raklein.me) for the latest version. I think this format works well for CVs that are fairly static, but I've since switched to a Word-based resume that I find more convenient to tailor for specific applications.

# To use:
1. Fork+Clone the repository (or just download all files to the same directory).
2. Ensure you have R and R Studio installed.
3. Open resume.Rproj in R Studio.
4. Customize klein_cv.Rmd to edit text (can rename file also).
5. (Optional) edit cv-latex.tex to edit formatting.
6. Click "knit" button in R Studio to output .pdf file.
